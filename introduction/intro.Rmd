# Session one

## 'Introduction to spatial data'

---

## What you will learn

- Loading R packages and data

- What is spatial data

- Creating static and interactive maps

- Overlaying several data types on a map

- Working with colour palettes on maps

---

## Example data we'll look at

- points (capital cities) 
- lines (highway network) 
- polygons (country boundaries) 
- gridded or raster data (population density)

```{r library_packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#### SECTION B: LOADING PACKAGES AND DATA ----

library(sf) 
library(raster) 
library(afrilearndata)
library(tmap)
library(rgdal)
library(mapview)

```

```{r set tmap plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tmap_mode("plot") 
```

```{r tmap-first-view, fig.height=3, dev='svg', echo=FALSE}

tmap::tm_shape(afripop2020) +
  tm_raster(palette = rev(viridisLite::magma(5)), breaks=c(0,2,20,200,2000,25000)) +
  tm_shape(africountries) +
  tm_borders("white", lwd = .5) +
  tm_shape(afrihighway) +
  tm_lines(col = "red") + 
  tm_shape(africapitals) +
  tm_symbols(col = "blue", alpha=0.4, scale = .6 )+
  tm_legend(show = FALSE)
```

---

### Example static maps we'll create

.pull-left[

```{r tmap-polygons-1c, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.8), out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

tm_shape(africountries) +
  tm_polygons(col="income_grp", border.col = "white")

```

]

.pull-right[

```{r tmap-raster1b, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.8), out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

tmap_mode('plot') 
tm_shape(afripop2020) +
  tm_raster(breaks=c(0,2,20,200,2000,25000))

```

]

---
### Example interactive maps we'll create


```{r set tmap plot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tmap_mode("view") 
```

```{r tmap-interactive, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.8), out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tmap::tm_shape(afripop2020) +
  tm_raster(palette = rev(viridisLite::magma(5)), breaks=c(0,2,20,200,2000,25000)) +
  tm_shape(africountries) +
  tm_borders("white", lwd = .5) +
  tm_text("iso_a3", size = "AREA") +
  tm_shape(afrihighway) +
  tm_lines(col = "blue") + 
  tm_shape(africapitals) +
  tm_symbols(col = "green",  scale = .6 ) +
  tm_legend(show = FALSE)

```

# Session two

## 'Reading my spatial data into R'

---

## What you will learn

- Read a variety of spatial data file types into R 

- Use `mapview` for quick interactive maps

- Options for making `mapview` maps more useful


---

## Interactive maps with `mapview`


```{r mapview-options-airports, fig.height=4, dev='svg', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# 1. read into dataframe
filename <- system.file("extdata", "afriairports.csv", package="afrilearndata", mustWork=TRUE)
mydf <- readr::read_csv(filename)

mydf <- mydf[(1:100), ] #select first 100 rows just to make quicker online

# or can select a single country:
# mydf <- mydf[which(mydf$country_name == "Burkina Faso"), ]

# 2. convert to sf object
mysf <- sf::st_as_sf(mydf, 
                     coords=c("longitude_deg", "latitude_deg"),
                     crs=4326)

# 3. quick interactive plot
#mapview(mysf)
mapview(mysf, zcol='type', label='name', cex=2)   

```

# Session three

## Practical

---

## What you will do

- Make a map from data of your own choice

- Learn where to find help 

- Share a screenshot or the code you used to create your map

---

## How this tutorial will work

Following this introduction, you will go to breakout rooms (English / French)
for the tutorial:

Topic |   | Duration
 :-- | --- | :-:
   |   | (minutes)
Navigating RStudio  |   | 15
Tutorial Session 1  |   | 50
Break  |   | 15
Tutorial Session 2  |   | 50
Break  |   | 15
Tutorial Session 3  |   | 50
Wrap up  |   | 5


Then back into the main training room for goodbyes

---

## Zoom

- After this introduction, when you are asked to join a break out room, click yes!

- At the end of the tutorial, the break out rooms will close and you will automatically be transferred back into the main room

- If you need help or have a question during the tutorial, please _**write a message in the zoom chat channel**_ - there are helpers and tutors in each break out room who will help you

- Please also note we have a _**shared google document**_ where you can ask questions, share ideas, etc. Please also take a minute to introduce yourselves here (the link has been pasted in the Zoom chat channel)
