```{r Suggested steps1}

#  Remember, to map these data in R usually requires a 3 step process.

# 1. read the data file into R (hint: `readr` package; `read_csv`)
WHOdf <- read_csv("/cloud/project/english/for_learners/data/WHO_Africa_HealthFacilities.csv")

#Andy: it's cool that these filepaths work on cloud from the console and running from the Rmd. Can we provide some brief instruction for what users should do if running the project locally ?

#Andy: brief explanation of some of my naming OCD, you can choose whether to use it or not (I realise that I don't always follow it either !) :-)
#I think I would use dfhealth & sfhealth & health_demo.csv
#I try to avoid capitals in object & filenames where possible to reduce risk of getting it wrong (for both learners & instructors !) & make typing easier.
#I would put df sf at start of object name - easier to see which object types you have
#I try avoid acronyms where possible - learners may not know them. Also in French WHO is Organisation Mondiale de la SantÃ© (OMS) !!  


```


```{r Suggested steps2}

# 2. convert the dataframe into an R spatial (package `sf`) object and set `crs` (hint: `sf::st_as_sf`)

WHOsf <- sf::st_as_sf(WHOdf, 
                      coords=c("Long", "Lat"),
                      crs=4326)
```


```{r Suggested steps3}

# 3. plot the `sf` object (create a quick interactive plot using `mapview`)
mapview(WHOsf)
```


```{r Extra steps1}

# 1. Practice exploring what the object contains (hint: e.g. `head`, `str`, `names`, `class`)
head(WHOsf)
#str(WHOsf)
#names(WHOsf)
#class(WHOsf)

```


``` {r Extra steps2}

# 2. What happens when you exclude the `crs` argument?
WHOsf <- sf::st_as_sf(WHOdf, 
                      coords=c("Long", "Lat"))
mapview(WHOsf)

# When there is no `crs` argument, the sf object is still created but mapview is unable to position it in the world. The points still appear but there is no map background.
```


``` {r Extra steps3}

# 3. Play with the arguments in `mapview` (e.g. `zcol`, `label`, `cex`)
WHOsf <- sf::st_as_sf(WHOdf, 
                      coords=c("Long", "Lat"),
                      crs=4326)

mapview(WHOsf, zcol='Admin1', label='Country', cex=5)

```
  

```{r `tmap`}
# Create a quick interactive plot using `tmap` (hint: `tmap_mode("plot")` for a static map; `tmap_mode("view")` for the interactive viewing mode)

tmap_mode("view")
tmap::tm_shape(WHOsf) +
  tm_symbols(col = "black", scale = 1)

```


```{r tmap & afrilearndata, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Combine your coordinate data with objects from afrilearndata
# Use your `sf` object from above and map using `tmap` (hint: use `tm_shape` & `tm_symbols`)

tmap::tm_shape(WHOsf) +
    tm_symbols(col = "black", scale = 1) +
  tm_shape(afripop2020) +
    tm_raster(palette = rev(viridisLite::magma(5)), breaks=c(0,2,20,200,2000,25000)) +
  tm_shape(africountries) +
    tm_borders("white", lwd = .5) +
  #   tm_text("iso_a3", size = "AREA") +
